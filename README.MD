# Disclaimer & Usage
Hey, this is designed for use with the [Baked modpack](https://thunderstore.io/package/blazingdrummer/BakedModpack/). I would really appreciate if you checked it out!

You are welcome to use it as an addon for the base game or other packs if you'd like, or as a template for making your own addon. Use it however you want!

# Installation
  1. Install a mod manager that can automatically install dependencies (I'd recommend Ebkr's excellent [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) manager).

  2. Install the BakedMutators "mod" to automatically install all of the mods and configure them.
    - With r2modman, simply install the program, create a new profile, click the **Online** section, and search for "BakedMutators". Then click **Download**.

  3. Disable any of the mutators that you *don't* want to play with, and leave the others enabled.
    - With r2modman, simply click on the mod and click the **Disable** button. The mod's name should then be crossed out and have a "Disabled" tag next to it.

  3. Read the overview below for a brief rundown on the different mutators below and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QRtdUbV) to stay up-to-date with any changes.

  4. Click **Play Modded**.

## How Do You Use This With Other Packs?
You should be able to follow steps 2-4 of the **Installation** section above with any profile in r2modman. However, because my testing process has been focused around this package's interactions with BakedModpack, I can't guarantee bug-free or balanced gameplay.
